<div class="lyrics">

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>
    You're right on the mountain<br>
    And up until the skies<br>
    I wouldn't like to dream here<br>
    'Cause I'd be far to high<br>
    Then life would be easy<br>
    With nothing to face<br>
    And then when I've landed<br>
    I'd have to face the whole human race<br>
    I don't like that life, cause it's too easy<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    Sometime it's hard to see the other side of the track<br>
    And I want to see those miracles<br>
    Coming right back coming right back, oh wo ho ...<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 2</div>

    I need this demon inside me<br>
    To keep my spirit alive<br>
    And if they took it away<br>
    Well, I'd be scared like a little child<br>
    And then life would be dangerous<br>
    with everything to face<br>
    Then I'd be a crisis<br>
    Of every god damn human in space<br>
    But I don't like that life â€˜cause it's not easy<br>

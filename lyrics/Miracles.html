<div class="lyrics">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    You're right on the mountain<br>

    And up until the skies<br>

    I wouldn't like to dream here<br>

    'Cause I'd be far to high<br>

    Then life would be easy<br>

    With nothing to face<br>

    And then when I've landed<br>

    I'd have to face the whole human race<br>

    I don't like that life, cause it's too easy<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    Sometime it's hard to see the other side of the track<br>

    And I want to see those miracles<br>

    Coming right back coming right back, oh wo ho ...<br>

    <br>

    I need this demon inside me<br>

    To keep my spirit alive<br>

    And if they took it away<br>

    Well, I'd be scared like a little child<br>

    And then life would be dangerous<br>

    with everything to face<br>

    Then I'd be a crisis<br>

    Of every god damn human in space<br>

    But I don't like that life â€˜cause it's not easy<br>



    [Repeat Chorus]<br>



    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

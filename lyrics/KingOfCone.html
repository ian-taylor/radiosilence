<div class="lyrics">
    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>

    Well, I was all dizzy and bored to my bones<br>
    Learning from a teacher that's got no soul<br>
    But I'm angry at me because it took so long<br>
    To discover myself next to the ocean<br>
    Taking the breeze like the King of cone<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 2</div>

    She's angry at me because I'm not insane<br>
    I wriggle like a widget in a tiresome game<br>
    She's angry at me but I can't complain<br>
    What do you know I'm next to the ocean<br>
    Living my life like the King of cone<br>
    King of Cone<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Bridge</div>

    Whatta you know I'm next to the ocean<br>
    Living my life like the King of cone<br>
    And all of this time I am living your dream<br>
    Creating a space in time<br>
    All of this time you've been pursuing your vocation<br>
    Where did your life go by<br>
    Said the King of Cone<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Outro</div>

    If you saw this place<br>
    It could be your island<br>
    And your scream inside<br>
    to see that I am the King of Cone<br>

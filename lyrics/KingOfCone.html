    <br>
    <br>
    Well, I was all dizzy and bored to my bones<br>

    Learning from a teacher that's got no soul<br>

    But I'm angry at me because it took so long<br>

    To discover myself next to the ocean<br>

    Taking the breeze like the King of cone<br>


    <br>
    She's angry at me because I'm not insane<br>

    I wriggle like a widget in a tiresome game<br>

    She's angry at me but I can't complain<br>

    What do you know I'm next to the ocean<br>

    Living my life like the King of cone<br>

    King of Cone<br>

    <br>

    Bridge:<br>

    Whatta you know I'm next to the ocean<br>

    Living my life like the King of cone<br>

    And all of this time I am living your dream<br>

    Creating a space in time<br>

    All of this time you've been pursuing your vocation<br>

    Where did your life go by<br>

    Said the King of Cone<br>


    <br>
    Outro:<br>

    If you saw this place<br>

    It could be your island<br>

    And your scream inside<br>

    to see that I am the King of Cone<br>

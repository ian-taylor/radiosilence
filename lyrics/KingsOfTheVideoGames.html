<div class="lyrics">

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>
    In the beginning they were pixelated <br>
    Low fidelity and not complicated<br>
    Over at MIT<br>
    Tic tac toe and moon landing will be<br>
    Frogger and Tetris<br>
    Space Invaders and Pac Man<br>

    Asteroid, Arkenoid <br>
    And Paper Boy in the land of Pong<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>

    Mario Bros, with its Heroic Acts<br>
    Polybius, with its Hypno Effects<br>
    Duck Hunt with its Creepy Dog<br>
    Q*bert with its Puzzling Hill<br>
    Street Fighter with its Violence and Gore<br>
    Track and Field with its Athletic Pixels<br>
    On a desktop and Emulated now<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    Kings of the Video Gamers<br>
    Kings of the Video Games<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Chorus]</div>
    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Chorus x 5]</div>

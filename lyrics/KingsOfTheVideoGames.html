    In the beginning they were pixelated, low fidelity and not complicated<br>

    Over at MIT, tic tac toe and moon landing will be<br>

    Frogger and Tetris, Space Invaders and Pac Man<br>

    Asteroid, Arkenoid, and Paper Boy in the land of Pong<br>
    <br>

    Mario Bros. with its Heroic Acts.<br>
    Polybius with its Hypno Effects.
    <br>
    Duck Hunt with its Creepy Dog.<br>
    Q*bert with its Puzzling Hill.<br>
    Street Fighter with its Violence and Gore.<br>
    Track and Field with its Athletic Pixels.<br>
    On a desktop and Emulated now<br>

    <br>
    Chorus:<br>
    Kings of the Video Gamers<br>
    Kings of the Video Games<br>

    <br>

    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    [Repeat Chorus]<br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    We're caught in a trap<br>

    I can't walk out<br>

    Because I love you too much, baby<br>

    Why can't you see<br>

    What you're doing to me<br>

    When you don't believe a word I say?<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    We can't go on together With suspicious minds <br>

    And we can't build our dreams on suspicious minds<br>


    <br>

    So, if an old friend I know<br>

    Stops by to say hello<br>

    Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?<br>



    Here we go again<br>

    Asking where I've been<br>

    You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying, yes, I'm crying<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>
    <br>


    Bridge:<br>

    Oh, let our love survive<br>

    I'll dry the tears from your eyes<br>

    Let's don't let a good thing die<br>

    When, honey, you know I've never lied to you<br>


    <br>
    We're caught in a trap<br>

    I can't walk out<br>

    Because I love you too much, baby<br>



    Why can't you see<br>

    What you're doing to me<br>

    When you don't believe a word I say?<br>

    <br>

    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    [Repeat Bridge]<br>

<div class="lyrics">
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>
    It feels like your mind’s on fire<br>
    It feels like your soul’s alive<br>
    It feels like the world’s on your side and you want and you wish<br>
    Your friends tell you to slow down<br>
    Telling you she’ll let you down<br>
    And they’ll advise you she’ll break your soul but you say no, you say no<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    She hides behind that smoke ring smile<br>
    She glides with that fashion and style<br>
    Her vibe makes you smile like a child<br>
    But it’s hard to live in the wild<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>

    Then the day comes when you’re as one<br>
    and you’ve proved everybody wrong<br>
    And you gloat at their mistrust, but you know, you know<br>
    The future’s uncertain with all<br>
    Whether you stand tall, or you stand small<br>
    life has its many turns and we know, yes we know<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Chorus]</div>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 3</div>
    The only way forward is by thought<br>
    the strength that you’ll make it work<br>
    And despite our inner concerns<br>
    That’s where we’ll go, where we’ll go<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Chorus]</div>

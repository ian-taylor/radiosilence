    <br>
    It feels like your mind’s on fire<br>
    It feels like your soul’s alive<br>
    It feels like the world’s on your side<br>
    and you want and you wish<br>
    <br>

    Your friends tell you to slow down<br>

    Telling you she’ll let you down<br>

    And they’ll advise you she’ll break your soul<br>

    But you say no, you say no<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    She hides behind that smoke ring smile<br>

    She glides with that fashion and style<br>

    Her vibe makes you smile like a child<br>

    But it’s hard to live in the wild<br>



    Then the day comes when you’re as one<br>

    and you’ve proved everybody wrong<br>

    And you gloat at their mistrust<br>

    But you know, but you know<br>



    The future’s uncertain with all<br>

    Whether you stand tall, or you stand small<br>

    life has its many turns<br>

    and we know, yes we know<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    <br>

    The only way forward is by thought<br>

    the strength that you’ll make it work<br>

    And despite our inner concerns<br>

    That’s where we’ll go, where we’ll go<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

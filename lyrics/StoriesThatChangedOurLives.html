<div class="lyrics">

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>
    Mr Webb was persecuted <br>
    Left for dead and mocked for being too truthful<br>
    And Rick Ross knew the truth <br>
    But belief in candor are the freeways, these days

    While Woodward met deep throat <br>
    In a parking garage at night, to get the insight<br>
    Bernstein was relentless in his quest <br>
    Following the money to the president elect<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    Where are the news<br>
    investigations<br>
    Where are the news<br>
    stories that changed our lives<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 2</div>

    The pentagon papers that Ellsburg famed  <br>
    Were far too fruitful for the Times to ignore<br>
    60,000 soldiers were lost in vein<br>
    For a truly senseless and despairing war of shame<br>
    While Freeway Rick was alive and well <br>
    Gary’s Webb was sent to the fire<br>
    He didn’t get see the corporate cull<br>
    Or what his dark alliance piece inspired<br>

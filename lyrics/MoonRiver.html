    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Moon river, wider than a mile<br>

    I'm crossing you in style someday<br>

    Oh, dream maker<br>

    You heartbreaker<br>

    Wherever you're going I'm going your way<br>

    Two drifters off to see the world<br>

    There's such a lot of world to see<br>

    We're after the same rainbow's end<br>

    Waiting round the bend<br>

    My huckleberry friend<br>

    Moon river and me<br>

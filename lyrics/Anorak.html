    <br>
    This is a story about a man<br>

    In a field<br>

    Enjoying the pleasures of life<br>

    He maybe obscure to you<br>

    But to him, he has the thing he needs<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    It feels like an anorak, smells like an anorak<br>

    repels like an anarch, and its owner collects trains<br>

    It sleazy like an anorak, kils breeze like an anorak<br>

    conceals like an anorak, it must be an anorak<br>

    <br>

    Verse1:<br>

    When you’re smiling and dancing in the rain<br>

    It's not cold<br>

    it must be an anorak<br>

    When you’re searching through pockets  for your book<br>

    It's not cold<br>

    it must be an anorak<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    <br>

    Verse2:<br>

    When it's freezing and you’re armed with your flask<br>

    It's not cold<br>

    it must be an anorak<br>

    When you’re obsessed and  watching all those trains<br>

    It's not cold<br>

    it must be an anorak<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Verse 1]<br>

    [Repeat Verse 2]  <br>

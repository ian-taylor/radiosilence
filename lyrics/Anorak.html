<div class="lyrics">

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Intro</div>
    This is a story about a man<br>
    In a field<br>
    Enjoying the pleasures of life<br>
    He maybe obscure to you<br>
    But to him, he has the thing he needs<br>


    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    It feels like an anorak, smells like an anorak<br>

    repels like an anarch, and its owner collects trains<br>

    It sleazy like an anorak, kils breeze like an anorak<br>

    conceals like an anorak, it must be an anorak<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>


    When you’re smiling and dancing in the rain<br>

    It's not cold, it must be an anorak<br>

    When you’re searching through pockets  for your book<br>

    It's not cold, it must be an anorak<br>


    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Chorus]</div>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 2</div>


    When it's freezing and you’re armed with your flask<br>

    It's not cold, it must be an anorak<br>

    When you’re obsessed and  watching all those trains<br>

    It's not cold, it must be an anorak<br>


    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Verse 1]</div>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Verse 2]</div>

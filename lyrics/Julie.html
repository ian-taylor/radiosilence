    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    I was sitting in the carriage<br>

    watching the sunset in my eyes<br>

    when the dolly with the trolly<br>

    came rattling with her sweets going by<br>

    Her name was Julie, so the man said<br>

    Julie, so I asked her and she said<br>

    I will, I will<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    Julie, you know I'll never fall in love with you<br>

    Julie, you know my heart could never be so true, for you<br>


    <br>
    When we got to central<br>

    we walked to the infamous railway bar<br>

    we were surrounded by leather and silver studs and we began to talk<br>

    I got to know her and he crazy ex<br>

    I thought some about that crazy ex<br>

    As he stared at me from the bar<br>

    It was like some strange movie<br>

    I guess she screwed me in a way I never thought<br>

    And fooled me in a flavour quite coarse<br>

    And you what, well, I got the hell out of there<br>

    <br>

    [Repeat Chorus]<br>


    <br>
    Bridge:<br>

    That was the first time I ever saw her face<br>

    And that was the last time I ever made that mistake<br>

<div class="lyrics">

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>

    I was sitting in the carriage<br>
    watching the sunset in my eyes<br>
    when the dolly with the trolly<br>
    came rattling with her sweets going by<br>
    Her name was Julie, so the man said<br>
    Julie, so I asked her and she said<br>
    I will, I will<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    Julie, you know I'll never fall in love with you<br>
    Julie, you know my heart could never be so true, for you<br>


    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 2</div>

    When we got to central<br>
    we walked to the infamous railway bar<br>
    we were surrounded by leather and silver studs and we began to talk<br>
    I got to know her and he crazy ex<br>
    I thought some about that crazy ex<br>
    As he stared at me from the bar<br>
    It was like some strange movie<br>
    I guess she screwed me in a way I never thought<br>
    And fooled me in a flavour quite coarse<br>
    And you what, well, I got the hell out of there<br>


    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">[Repeat Chorus]</div>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Bridge</div>

    That was the first time I ever saw her face<br>
    And that was the last time I ever made that mistake<br>

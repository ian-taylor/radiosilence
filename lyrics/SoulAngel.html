<div class="lyrics">
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
   You are my soul angel<br>

    You came and saved my life<br>

    I searched for something different<br>

    which never materialised<br>


    Your eyes have live a thousand times<br>

    I felt alive for the first time<br>

    To see beyond this life is real<br>

    A world beyond existence<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    Soul angel<br>

    You define me<br>

    Soul angel keeping me free<br>

    Soul angel<br>

    You define me<br>

    Soul angel keeping me free<br>


    <br>
    Stop signs and sidewalks are real<br>

    Our rules define and become us<br>

    Life is a paradox in itself<br>

    You just get in your box and behave<br>

    but the life you gave me is real<br>

    Its absolved the pain of being<br>

    Our future is as real as life could be<br>

    And far away from existence<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

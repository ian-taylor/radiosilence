<div class="lyrics">
    <br>
    I woke with a bad head<br>

    Looking like I’ve never been fed<br>

    I looked at my eyes and they were burning<br>

    I tried to sleep some more<br>

    But my mind was working the chore<br>

    And the doorbell dinged, presumably to please me<br>

    <br>

    Chorus:<br>

    So don’t look at me<br>

    Don’t stare at me<br>

    Don’t even smile, 'cause I’ve had a bad day<br>

    <br>

    I stumbled to the front door<br>

    Fell with my head back to the floor<br>

    And even the moon was there to greet me<br>



    Well, it was quiet as a mouse<br>

    Flow it with water my head I did douse<br>

    And the street was clear as the breeze that freed me<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>


    <br>
    Bridge:<br>

    To bad today you’re happy - And I’m estranged<br>

    Your a stranger and I’m estranged - I’m bad<br>

    To bad today you’re happy - And I’m estranged<br>

    Your a stranger and I’m estranged - And I’ve had it bad<br>

    I’ve had a bad day<br>

    <br>

    [Repeat Chorus]<br>

    <br>

    Outro:<br>

    Bad Day, I’ve had a bad day<br>

    So when you people are walking on the street<br>

    Just walk on by, because I’ve had a bad day<br>

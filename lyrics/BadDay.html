<div class="lyrics">
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Verse 1</div>
    I woke with a bad head<br>
    Looking like I’ve never been fed<br>
    I looked at my eyes and they were burning<br>
    I tried to sleep some more<br>
    But my mind was working the chore<br>
    And the doorbell dinged, presumably to please me<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 8px"></div>
    <div style="font-weight: bold">Chorus</div>

    So don’t look at me, don’t stare at me<br>
    Don’t even smile, 'cause I’ve had a bad day<br>

    <div style="margin-top: 12px"></div>

    I stumbled to the front door<br>
    Fell with my head back to the floor<br>
    And even the moon was there to greet me<br>
    Well, it was quiet as a mouse<br>
    Flow it with water my head I did douse<br>
    And the street was clear as the breeze that freed me<br>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Bridge</div>

    To bad today you’re happy - And I’m estranged<br>
    Your a stranger and I’m estranged - I’m bad<br>
    To bad today you’re happy - And I’m estranged<br>
    Your a stranger and I’m estranged - And I’ve had it bad, I’ve had a bad day<br>

    <div style="font-weight: bold">Outro</div>

    Bad Day, I’ve had a bad day<br>
    So when you people are walking on the street<br>
    Just walk on by, because I’ve had a bad day<br>

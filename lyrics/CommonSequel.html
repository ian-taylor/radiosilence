    Living your life to the common sequel, not living it to the full<br>

    Living up to your future's equal, don't you know that that's dull?<br>

    Please let me take you out of here, let me show you your other future<br>

    I know what they say its best, but who's best and who's the teacher<br>


    <br>
    Chorus:<br>

    I want to show you this world<br>

    After all your just the same as me<br>

    And then maybe you can see a future<br>

    After all those changes you'd be free<br>


    <br>
    In their eyes your their only child so I can take their point<br>

    But did they live their life to their parents' wishes, now do they take my point?<br>

    You just can't go on living your life to suite the others around you<br>

    It’s just about time you turned around and left their dreams behind you<br>


    <br>
    [Repeat Chorus]<br>


    <br>
    You’ll be free<br>

    You’ll be free<br>

    You’ll be free<br>

    You’ll be free<br>
